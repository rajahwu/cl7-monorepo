# Git Commit Summary - 2025-11-25-172153

**Agent:** gemini

**Commit:** 6318320

## Summary

This commit introduces a new `REPORTS` directory to store agent-generated reports. It also establishes a naming convention for these reports and defines an initial set of report types.

## Changes

-   **`REPORTS/` (new directory):**
    -   `REPORTS/README.md` (new file): This file documents the naming convention and report types for agent-generated reports. The naming convention is `<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS>_<agent-name>_<report-type>.md`.
    -   `REPORTS/2025-11-25-171740_gemini_initial-evaluation.md` (renamed from `REPORTS.md`): The existing `REPORTS.md` file was moved into the new directory and renamed to follow the new convention.

## Analysis

This change improves the organization of the repository by creating a dedicated directory for reports. The naming convention will make it easier to identify and manage reports in the future. The defined report types provide a good starting point for a more structured reporting system.

**Note:** This is an initial analysis. The report types and naming convention may be subject to change.
