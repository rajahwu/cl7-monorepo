This folder contains UI-focused SetDefinitions intended for component libraries and dashboards. The sets included are:

- **BoxKit** — friendly, modular UI tokens
- **TechLaw** — formal, authoritative UI tokens
- **ElementSeven** — modern, compact UI tokens for dense interfaces (Dark Mode optimized)

Each file exports a `SetDefinition` instance. Import them from `@clearline7/set-definitions` after updating the package index.
