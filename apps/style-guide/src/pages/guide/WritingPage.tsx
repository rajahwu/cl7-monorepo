      <h1>Writing Style Guidelines</h1>

      <p>
        These guidelines establish the default voice and tone for Clearline7-styled content.
        Individual Style Sets may adjust specific elements, but these principles serve as the
        baseline.
      </p>

        <h2>Voice & Tone</h2>

        <h3>The Clearline7 Voice</h3>
        <p>
          Our voice is <strong>professional, confident, and supportive</strong>. We communicate with
          authority but never condescension. We're experts sharing knowledge, not gatekeepers
          protecting it.
        </p>

        <h3>Tone Variations by Context</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Formal documents</strong> — Measured, precise, third-person preferred
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Technical documentation</strong> — Direct, instructional, second-person
            acceptable
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Marketing/web content</strong> — Engaging, benefit-focused, conversational
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Internal communications</strong> — Clear, efficient, action-oriented
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>On-Brand vs. Off-Brand</h2>

        <h3>On-Brand Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>"This guide establishes standards for document formatting."</li>
          <li>"Select the Style Set that matches your document's purpose."</li>
          <li>"Follow these steps to configure your template."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Off-Brand Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>"You should probably maybe try to follow these rules if you can."</li>
          <li>"This super awesome guide will totally help you out!"</li>
          <li>"Per the aforementioned stipulations herein contained..."</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Key distinction:</strong> On-brand writing is direct without being curt,
          professional without being stuffy, and helpful without being patronizing.
