      <h1>Branding Philosophy & Mission</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Clearline7 exists to give teams one clear way to communicate—so every document reads as if
          it came from the same mind. We provide an unparalleled, training-backed brand system that
          balances government-style precision with modern publishing flair.

        <h2>Core Values</h2>

        <h3>Clarity</h3>
        <p>
          Every decision—from font choice to sentence structure—serves comprehension. We eliminate
          ambiguity in both visual and verbal communication.
        </p>

        <h3>Consistency</h3>
        <p>
          Standards exist to be followed. When teams adopt a Style Set, they commit to its complete
          system, not cherry-picked elements.
        </p>

        <h3>Authority</h3>
        <p>
          Our standards derive from established references: Gregg Reference Manual, Tongue and
          Quill, The Elements of Style. We don't invent rules—we synthesize proven practices.
        </p>

        <h3>Adaptability</h3>
        <p>
          Seven Style Sets serve different contexts. Federal Flow for government rigor. Clearline7
          for modern tech. The system flexes without compromising integrity.

        <h2>Brand Voice Persona</h2>
        <p>
          Clearline7 speaks as a <strong>confident expert</strong>—knowledgeable, professional, yet
          approachable. We guide without condescension. We establish standards without rigidity.
        </p>

        <h3>Voice Attributes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Authoritative</strong> — We know our subject and speak with certainty
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clear</strong> — Complex ideas expressed simply
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Supportive</strong> — Enabling success, not gatekeeping
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Modern</strong> — Contemporary sensibility, not dusty formalism
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Dual Tension</h2>
        <p>Our brand lives at the intersection of two traditions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Government Precision</strong> — Procedural clarity, compliance-ready,
            audit-proof
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Creative Publishing</strong> — Visual sophistication, modern aesthetics, reader
            engagement
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each Style Set embodies a different position on this spectrum. Federal Flow leans toward
          procedural precision. Clearline7 balances both. Blog Posts embraces expressive creativity.
