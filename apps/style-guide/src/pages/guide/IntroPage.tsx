        <h2>What This Guide Covers</h2>
        <p>
          This guide serves as the foundational source of truth for the Clearline7 style system. It
          establishes standards for two interconnected domains:
        </p>

        <h3>Document Style Guidelines</h3>
        <p>
          Templates, formatting rules, layout structures, and visual specifications that govern how
          documents appear. These include typography settings, spacing values, color palettes, and
          component styling.
        </p>

        <h3>Writing Style Guidelines</h3>
        <p>
          Prose-level standards covering tone, voice, grammar conventions, and language usage. These
          ensure consistency in how content reads and communicates across all materials.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>Why Both Matter</h2>
        <p>
          A document can be perfectly formatted yet poorly written—or brilliantly written but
          visually inconsistent. Clearline7 addresses both layers because professional communication
          requires harmony between structure and substance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each Style Set (Federal Flow, Clearline7, ClerkRoom Standard, etc.) provides complete
          specifications for both domains, ensuring that visual and verbal identity align.

        <h2>The "Version Zero" Standard</h2>
        <p>
          This document represents Version Zero—the foundational baseline from which all Clearline7
          style decisions derive. Future updates will build upon this foundation while maintaining
          backward compatibility where possible.
