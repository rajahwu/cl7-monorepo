1. A minimalist, flat vector-style icon of a blog post glyph. The design features crisp geometric shapes with sharp edges and precise alignment. The color palette is strictly limited to deep blue (#1E3A8A) and teal (#14B8A6) against a pure white background. No gradients, shadows, or three-dimensional effects are used, ensuring a clean, modern 2D appearance suitable for UI design. High contrast and perfect symmetry.
2. A minimalist, flat vector-style icon representing a stack of articles or documents. The composition uses simple geometric rectangular forms arranged to imply depth without perspective or shading. Colors are solid deep blue (#1E3A8A) and teal (#14B8A6). The style is strictly 2D, with no gradients or drop shadows, maintaining a clean, technical aesthetic.
3. A flat, 2D vector illustration depicting abstract web blog layouts. The design showcases simplified wireframe-like representations of headers, text blocks, and image placeholders. The artwork uses a palette of deep blue (#1E3A8A) and teal (#14B8A6) on a white background. Lines are clean and uniform in weight. There is absolutely no shading, texture, or depth; the style is purely graphical and schematic.
4. A flat, vector-style illustration of article preview cards. The design includes abstract representations of thumbnails and text lines using geometric shapes. The color scheme is composed of deep blue (#1E3A8A) and teal (#14B8A6). The execution is precise with clean, unvarying line weights and solid color fills. No gradients, textures, or lighting effects are present, adhering to a strict flat design system.
