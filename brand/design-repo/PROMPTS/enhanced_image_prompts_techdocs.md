1. A minimalist, flat vector-style icon of a documentation glyph. The design features a document shape with lines of text. The color palette is strictly limited to indigo (#312E81) and cyan (#06B6D4) against a pure white background. No gradients, shadows, or three-dimensional effects.
2. A minimalist, flat vector-style icon representing a code snippet. The composition uses bracket symbols and abstract indented lines. Colors are solid indigo (#312E81) and cyan (#06B6D4). The style is strictly 2D, with no gradients.
3. A minimalist, flat vector-style icon of a technical diagram. The design features interconnected nodes or blocks. The color palette is strictly limited to indigo (#312E81) and cyan (#06B6D4) against a pure white background. Clean, technical lines.
4. A flat, 2D vector illustration depicting technical documents. The design showcases simplified wireframe-like representations of manuals or specifications. The artwork uses a palette of indigo (#312E81) and cyan (#06B6D4) on a white background. No shading or texture.
5. A flat, vector-style illustration of code diagrams. The design includes abstract representations of architecture or logic flows using geometric shapes. The color scheme is composed of indigo (#312E81) and cyan (#06B6D4). Precise execution with solid color fills.
