1. A minimalist, flat vector-style icon of a modular box composed of distinct geometric shapes. The design uses solid teal (#0F9D9A) and vibrant orange (#FF8A4B) colors against a neutral background. There are no gradients, shadows, or three-dimensional effects, maintaining a clean, modern, and purely 2D aesthetic with sharp, precise lines.
2. A minimalist, flat vector-style icon depicting an onboarding arrow. The arrow is constructed from geometric forms, pointing forward or downwards to suggest progression. It is rendered in solid teal (#0F9D9A) and orange (#FF8A4B) with clean, sharp edges. No gradients, shadows, or depth are present, emphasizing a flat, directional design.
3. A minimalist, flat vector-style icon representing a friendly button glyph. The glyph features simple, approachable geometric shapes, potentially a checkmark or a simple affirmative symbol. It is colored in solid teal (#0F9D9A) and orange (#FF8A4B). The icon is strictly 2D, with no gradients, shadows, or complex textures, conveying clarity and functionality.
4. A flat, 2D vector illustration showcasing abstract modular UI panels. The composition features various interconnected geometric panel shapes, suggestive of user interface elements. The color scheme exclusively uses solid teal (#0F9D9A) and orange (#FF8A4B). The artwork has clean, consistent line weights and uniform color fills, with no shading, shadows, or volumetric elements.
5. A flat, 2D vector illustration of an abstract onboarding flow. The design depicts a sequence of geometric arrows and simple, abstract placeholders for steps, illustrating a progression. The entire illustration is rendered in solid teal (#0F9D9A) and orange (#FF8A4B). It maintains clean lines and consistent fill, with no shading, depth effects, or complex artistic flourishes.
